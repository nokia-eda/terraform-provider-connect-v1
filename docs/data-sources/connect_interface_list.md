<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `namespace` (String) the namespace scope in which to operate

### Optional

- `fields` (String) a comma-separated list of resource fields to fetch/return.  If unspecified, all fields are fetched.  If empty, only key-fields are fetched.
- `filter` (String) an EQL "where" expression that will be used to filter the set of resources returned.
- `label_selector` (String) a label selector string to filter the results based on CR labels
- `labelselector` (String) Deprecated: a label selector string to filter the results based on CR labels

### Read-Only

- `api_version` (String)
- `items` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `kind` (String)

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Optional:

- `spec` (Attributes) ConnectInterfaceSpec defines the desired state of ConnectInterface. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec))

Read-Only:

- `alarms` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--alarms))
- `api_version` (String)
- `deviations` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--deviations))
- `kind` (String)
- `metadata` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--metadata))
- `status` (Attributes) ConnectInterfaceStatus defines the observed state of ConnectInterface (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--status))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec`

Optional:

- `bond` (Attributes) Bond is an Optional Bond definition, indicating the naming of a Bond on the Compute. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--bond))
- `members` (Attributes List) Members is a list of InterfaceMembers indicating which Compute Interfaces are part of this ConnectInterface.
For non-LAG interfaces, this is a list of one element. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--members))

### Nested Schema for `items.spec.bond`

Optional:

- `chassis_id` (String) ChassisID is the Chassis Id of the top-of-rack switch to which this compute interface is connected, received through LLDP.
- `host_name` (String) HostName is the FQDN of the host this compute port belongs to (eg. compute01.example.com).
- `interface_name` (String) InterfaceName is the interface name of the compute port (eg. eth0).
- `port_id` (String) PortID is the Port Id of the top-of-rack switch to which this compute interface is connected, received through LLDP.
- `system_name` (String) SystemName is the name of the top-of-rack switch to which this compute interface is connected, received through LLDP.

### Nested Schema for `items.spec.members`

Optional:

- `chassis_id` (String) ChassisID is the Chassis Id of the top-of-rack switch to which this compute interface is connected, received through LLDP.
